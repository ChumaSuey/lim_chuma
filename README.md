# "Anomalous Sunshine of an Alternate Timeline" / Alkaline (Quake mod)
Map entry for Alkaline (Quake) jam "Liminal Spaces" Alk 1.2.2b
There's a small instruction and detail / spoilery below, you can read it to get context or go blindly... this is a bit of a story/lore map with 2 phases : Suspense/Puzzle and action.

### Author info

Map name : Anomalous Sunshine of an Alternate Timeline.

Author : Chuma.

### How to play it? and General instructions/context/technical details

It should be playable in the jam, drop it in your Alkaline directory as i've used sounds from Alkaline pak1. This map was playtested in Ironwail.

As an author petition:
- Please play with the music from the map.
- If you are a speedrunner, enjoy the experience of the map first, then speedrun (if you'd like if not no worries as long as you have fun)

This map is intended to be a "lore condensed" mystery map and also an action map, so i'm going to summarize the context:

Ranger has ended up in a place called "The Connector", that's intended to be a world that connect other worlds and universes(multiverses), This dimension was overtaken by the Strogg forces, but it's been so long (a lot of unspecified years have passed) that they haven't seen any other humanoid creature... Ranger is being helped by someone to escape this place so here comes the basic context : Get the 4 circuit boards to fix the Dimensional jumper... you will be presented with 4 paths (should you go for one path, you have to finish it, and you can't return):

The map is divided in 2 phases:
1. Exploration/Puzzle with 4 different paths.
2. Action (since them Stroggs obviously won't let you go easily).

During the first phase of the map DO NOT attack or fight the enemies, there's no reward for it (if you are a speedrunner you may use them for timesave purposes i understand and can't stop this, but it's not any worth, since they will be killtargeted after the path, and there's no health, only armor shards.

Music tracks used:
Repulsive - Departure.
Repulsive - 1908 Vol 1 (Vol I).
The most mysterious song on the internet by the most mysterious band (i hope i can get to change this when they find the song's author).

Repulsive tracks are copyright free.

The Most Mysterious song on the internet is a weird case but it's author hasn't been found, i'm willing to talk with the authors of the song (if they are found) if any change is needed but i'd prefer this song be kept within the map content, as it's basically a tribute to this long time internet mystery, i hope we find out who did it... I ask to the authors of the song if found, leave the quake content creators play my map with the song as it's been envisioned since the beginning :).
