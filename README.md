# "Anomalous Sunshine of an Alternate Timeline" / Alkaline (Quake mod)
Map entry for Alkaline (Quake) jam "Liminal Spaces" Alk 1.2.2b
There's a small instruction and detail / spoilery below, you can read it to get context or go blindly... this is a bit of a story/lore map with 2 phases : Suspense/Puzzle and action.

### Author info

Map name : Anomalous Sunshine of an Alternate Timeline.

Author : Chuma.

### How to play it? and General instructions/context/technical details

It should be playable in the jam, drop it in your Alkaline directory as i've used sounds from Alkaline pak1. This map was playtested in Ironwail.

As an author petition:
- Please play with the music from the map.
- If you are a speedrunner, enjoy the experience of the map first, then speedrun (if you'd like if not no worries as long as you have fun)

This map is intended to be a "lore condensed" mystery map and also an action map, so i'm going to summarize the context:

Ranger has ended up in a place called "The Connector", that's intended to be a world that connect other worlds and universes(multiverses), This dimension was overtaken by the Strogg forces, but it's been so long (a lot of unspecified years have passed) that they haven't seen any other humanoid creature... Ranger is being helped by someone to escape this place so here comes the basic context : Get the 4 circuit boards to fix the Dimensional jumper... you will be presented with 4 paths (should you go for one path, you have to finish it, and you can't return):

The map is divided in 2 phases:
1. Exploration/Puzzle with 4 different paths.
2. Action (since them Stroggs obviously won't let you go easily).

During the first phase of the map DO NOT attack or fight the enemies, there's no reward for it (if you are a speedrunner you may use them for timesave purposes i understand and can't stop this, but it's not any worth, since they will be killtargeted after the path, and there's no health, only armor shards.

### Behind the scenes / Production of the map (includes spoiler)

Here in this link is the list of the secrets and how to find them! the best scare of the map is basically within a secret area, yeah sorry for that (?):

https://github.com/ChumaSuey/lim_chuma/wiki/Secrets

I'm proud of how much work i've put into this map but well, let's get rolling:

For a while i had the idea of using The Mysterious Song on the internet, just a small scare sequence of the map playing within a radio, trapping the player and sliding it down into a fight... i always had this sequence in mind, in my notebook of sketches this map was called "The sun will never shine" and it was thought for a possible Progs dump speedmapping. When the Liminal jam was proposed i knew i could workout this concept within the level... altho the idea of using the mysterious song as a sound effect was discarded since it wouldn't sound right.

This is the first map i've managed to use references for my levels, so the map started to get made based on the previous short concept + the idea of going through different non-linear non-returnable areas that are backrooms, merging up both concepts into one : A first phase of backroom exploration, and a second phase of a "mall" fight (if i could call the second phase area as a mall).

The areas are path 1 to 4 counter-clockwise (this was completely unintentional but well... it works)

In this map altho story or lore densed with Trigger_textstories, they are completely optional, only what the player needs to know are the basic instructions get the 4 circuit boards and then fight.

The references :
Path 1 - Yellow void room comes from the Backroom area that has different squared voids or black holes.
Path 2 - Pool room comes from Counter strike Pool day but from a picture that uses liminal textures for it (i saw that version before somewhere but i can't remember).
Path 3 - "Urban room/hotel" comes from The liminal hotel that exists in real life, the last time i tried to find that picture, someone went there and said that "liminal space" can't be accessed by the public
Path 4 - "Bathroom / Train bathroom" comes from some bathroom and train station pictures, i was making a Train station in my mind, but it ended up looking like a bathroom so... no idea it's abstract.

Phase 2 the fight for the exit : The reference was the mall (the idea i wanted to make that comes from the mysterious song being played on a mall video), a liminal mall... in my mind it is, altho it looks very much abstract.

I added a jumppad that should work to get your weapons back if you failed to miss them when falling to Phase 2, altho i made the clips and spaces narrow so this hardly happens.

Map also has 2 target_autosaves (Alkaline saves) for preventing incidents of complex level finishing or level restart.

Music tracks used:
Repulsive - Departure.
Repulsive - 1908 Vol 1 (Vol I).
The most mysterious song on the internet by the most mysterious band (i hope i can get to change this when they find the song's author).

Repulsive tracks are copyright free.

The Most Mysterious song on the internet is a weird case but it's author hasn't been found, i'm willing to talk with the authors of the song (if they are found) if any change is needed but i'd prefer this song be kept within the map content, as it's basically a tribute to this long time internet mystery, i hope we find out who did it... I ask to the authors of the song if found, leave the quake content creators play my map with the song as it's been envisioned since the beginning :).
